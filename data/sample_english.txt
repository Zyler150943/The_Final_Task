Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. The process involves several key steps:

1. Data Collection: Gathering relevant data from various sources.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
3. Feature Engineering: Selecting and transforming variables.
4. Model Selection: Choosing appropriate algorithms.
5. Training: Teaching the model using training data.
6. Evaluation: Testing model performance on unseen data.
7. Deployment: Implementing the model in real-world applications.

There are three main types of machine learning:
- Supervised Learning: Uses labeled data (classification, regression)
- Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns in unlabeled data (clustering)
- Reinforcement Learning: Learns through rewards and penalties

Applications include image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles.
